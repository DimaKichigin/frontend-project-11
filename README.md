## Description:

[RSS Reader](https://frontend-project-11-six-sigma.vercel.app/) is a service for aggregating RSS feeds that makes it easy to read a variety of sources, such as blogs or your favorite news. It allows you to add an unlimited number of RSS feeds, update them and add new entries to the whole stream.

**How to use it:**

• Find a blog or news feed, which you prefer to read

• Use `link-to-RSS` converters to make your blog/news link suitable for [RSS Reader](https://frontend-project-11-six-sigma.vercel.app/)

• Make sure the link is a file with `.xml` markup

• Add this link to the feed

• If you need to change the language, press `RU/EN` button in the upper-right corner

• All downloaded feeds would constantly update every 5 seconds, so you won't miss anything

• That's it!
